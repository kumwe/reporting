# Integration

Consume only an independently verified immutable release; exact pins are mandatory before 1.0. App supplies already authorized values and trusted definitions. Database adapters, scope authority, policy enforcement, signing secrets, persistence and delivery remain in App. No change to historical owners happens in this Phase 1 branch.

## Source and archive verification


The frozen conformance corpus records unchanged App oracle results over already normalized/authorized input. Engine owns execution and consumes the corpus; no PHP executor or host authority is introduced here.

Run `composer install` and `composer check`. Source CI installs exact published Kumwe dependencies and builds an isolated no-dev classmap-authoritative archive consumer. The complete gate includes package-owned behavior, boundary and conformance tests, static analysis, API and ownership checks, release automation fixtures and clean-consumer verification.

Exact pre-1.0 dependency pins change through reviewed update PRs. A moving `latest` coordinate would make the verified dependency closure irreproducible.

Access Control 0.1.0 is published on GitHub but was absent from Packagist during the 2026-09-07 review. Root consumers must retain the declared Access Control VCS repository until registry publication is complete; Composer does not inherit dependency repositories. The other dependencies resolve through Packagist.
