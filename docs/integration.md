# Integration

Consume only an independently verified immutable release; exact pins are mandatory before 1.0. App supplies already authorized values and trusted definitions. Database adapters, scope authority, policy enforcement, signing secrets, persistence and delivery remain in App. See the [Core contract](core-contract.md) for current ownership.

## Source and archive verification


The frozen conformance corpus records unchanged App oracle results over already normalized/authorized input. Engine owns execution and consumes the corpus; no PHP executor or host authority is introduced here.

Run `composer install` and `composer check`. Source CI installs exact published Kumwe dependencies and builds an isolated no-dev classmap-authoritative archive consumer. The complete gate includes package-owned behavior, boundary and conformance tests, static analysis, API and ownership checks, release automation fixtures and clean-consumer verification.

Exact pre-1.0 dependency pins change through reviewed update PRs. A moving `latest` coordinate would make the verified dependency closure irreproducible.

The exact runtime dependency graph resolves through Packagist. Custom root VCS overrides are not required.
Dependency readiness and the clean no-dev consumer verify the declared package closure.
